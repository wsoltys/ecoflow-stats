# POC to get status information from an EcoFlow power station

This work is heavily based on "EcoFlow Portable Power Station Integration for Home Assistant" which can be found here:  
https://github.com/vwt12eh8/hassio-ecoflow  
It uses the local API and therefore needs to be on the same network as the power station.

This is just a poc but it seems to work with my RIVER 600 Pro
